# Chicago-school-socioeconomic-analysis
Study of Chicago Crime, Public School and Socioeconomic Data

There is a general ‘theory’ that student success in school is affected by their home environment specifically socioeconomic status.  An analysis was completed using MySQL and Python to analyze the data and create various graphs to see if there is a correlation between student performance and socioeconomic status.

The files in the repository comprise of the MySQL queries and the Python code used to create the graphs.

Python files with the word 'updated' in the name had to be changed to work with SQLalchemy 2.0 since they were originally written for previous version.  The .execute function does not work with new version.


Python was used on:
